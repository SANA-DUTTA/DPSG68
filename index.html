                The school, affiliated to Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has been able to provide a perfect blend of academics, sports, and co-curricular activities for all the students from Grades Nursery-XII since its inception. The drive is still on. Today, the school is a known and highly valued educational establishment in the region. The efforts and passion to ideate and innovate have not ceased, thus keeping complacency at bay.
                DPS Gandhinagar has been able to maintain its stature and image from the beginning due to its backbone, i.e. passionate brigade of teachers guided by a highly experienced and progressive educationist, who is the Head of the School. The teachers are encouraged to experiment, evolve, and implement newer and better teaching practices, hence making them more responsible and better involved. Further, they undergo different kinds of training conducted by veterans of education sector that nurtures them further.</p>
